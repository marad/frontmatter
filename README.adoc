* âœ… **Modify specific fields** without affecting others
* âœ… **Retrieve frontmatter content** or specific fields
* âœ… **Delete frontmatter** entirely or specific fields
* âœ… **Nested field support** with dot notation (`object.field`)
* âœ… **Multiple operations** in a single command
* âœ… **Dry-run mode** to preview changes
* âœ… **Performance optimized** for large files
* âœ… **Safe atomic writes** to prevent data corruption
* âœ… **Exit codes** for scripting and automation

== Installation

=== From Source

[source,bash]

frontmatter set message="Hello World" file.md
----

Set nested fields with dot notation:
[source,bash]
----
frontmatter set object.field=5 file.md
----

Set multiple fields at once:

----

=== Flags

==== `--dry-run`

Preview changes without modifying the file:
[source,bash]
----
frontmatter set title="New Title" --dry-run file.md
----

== Data Types

The tool automatically detects and handles various data types:

* **Strings**: `message="Hello World"`
* **Integers**: `count=42`
* **Floats**: `price=19.99`
* **Booleans**: `published=true`
* **Arrays**: `tags=[tag1,tag2,tag3]`
* **Objects**: `config={"key":"value"}`

== Examples

=== Basic Usage

Create a new file with frontmatter:
[source,bash]
----
echo "# My Article" > article.md
frontmatter set title="My First Post" author="John Doe" article.md
----

Result:
[source,yaml]
----
---
title: My First Post
author: John Doe
---
# My Article
----

=== Working with Nested Data

[source,bash]
----
frontmatter set config.database.host="localhost" config.database.port=5432 article.md
----

Result:
[source,yaml]
----
---
config:
  database:
    host: localhost
    port: 5432
---
----

=== Querying Data

[source,bash]
----
# Get specific field
frontmatter get title article.md
# Output: My First Post

# Get nested field
frontmatter get config.database.host article.md
# Output: localhost

# Get entire frontmatter as YAML
frontmatter get article.md
----

=== Batch Operations

[source,bash]
----
# Set multiple fields
frontmatter set \
  title="Updated Title" \
  updated="2025-06-06" \
  tags="[tech,golang,cli]" \
  article.md

# Delete multiple fields
frontmatter delete draft updated article.md
----

== Exit Codes

The tool uses standard exit codes for scripting:

* `0` - Success
* `1` - General error (invalid arguments, file errors, etc.)
* `2` - Not found (field doesn't exist, no frontmatter found)

=== Scripting Example

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
if frontmatter get published article.md; then
    echo "Article is published"
else
    echo "Article is not published or field doesn't exist"
fi
----

== Performance

The tool is optimized for performance with large files:

* **Optimized I/O**: Only reads frontmatter section for `get` operations
* **Atomic writes**: Uses temporary files to prevent corruption
* **Memory efficient**: Streams large files instead of loading entirely into memory

== File Format Support

The tool works with any text file containing YAML frontmatter:

* **Markdown files** (`.md`, `.markdown`)
* **HTML files** (`.html`, `.htm`)
* **Text files** (`.txt`)
* **Any other text format**

[source,yaml]

author: John Doe
date: 2025-06-06
